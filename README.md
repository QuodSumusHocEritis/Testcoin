What is Testcoin?
----------------
Testcoin is a fork of Litecoin 0.8 using scrypt as a proof-of-work algorithm.  This is for academic research, hence the uncommon tokenomic parameters below.
 - 1 minute block targets
 - subsidy halves in 10k blocks (~2 weeks)
 - ~201250 total coins
 - 10 coins per block
 - 2880 blocks to retarget difficulty
